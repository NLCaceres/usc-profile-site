            Assignment 8: The Final Project - The Latest Car Site for All Your
            Next Car Info Needs! Car Lords
          </a>
          <p class="assignment-description">
            For the last assignment from ITP 301 at USC, I decided I would try
            and make something in the style of Car Gurus, incorporating two
            jQuery plugins to implement a slider and a modal popover alongside
            W3CSS. By making requests to the Edmunds API, I'd swap out
            components to display articles and nearby cars that relate to the
            user's search in place of the base URL's display. The trick was
            doing so without a front-end framework and simply in jQuery and
            vanilla JavaScript.
